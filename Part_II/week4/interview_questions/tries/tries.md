## ****Question 1****

**Prefix free codes.** In data compression, a set of binary strings is if no string is a prefix of another. For example, {01,10,0010,1111} is prefix free, but {01,10,0010,10100} is not because 10 is a prefix of 10100. Design an efficient algorithm to determine if a set of binary strings is prefix-free. The running time of your algorithm should be proportional the number of bits in all of the binary strings.

## Answer

- add strings(keys) with distinct values to a trie
- if the path of a newly added string passes through any existing leaves, itâ€™s not prefix free
- otherwise, itâ€™s prefix free

## ****Question 2****

**Boggle.** Boggle is a word game played on an 4-by-4 grid of tiles, where each tile contains one letter in the alphabet. The goal is to find all words in the dictionary that can be made by following a path of adjacent tiles (with no tile repeated), where two tiles are adjacent if they are horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbors.
