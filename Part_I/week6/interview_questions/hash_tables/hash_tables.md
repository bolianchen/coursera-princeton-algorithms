# Hash Tables
## Question1: 4-SUM.
Given an array a[] of n integers, the 4-SUM problem is to determine if there exist distinct
indices i, j, k, and l such that a[i] + a[j] = a[k] + a[l].
Design an algorithm for the 4-SUM problem that takes time proportional to n^2
(under suitable technical assumptions).

## Question2: Hashingwith wrong hashCode() or equals().
Suppose that you implement a data type OlympicAthlete for use in a java.util.HashMap.

* Describe what happens if you override hashCode() but not equals().
* Describe what happens if you override equals() but not hashCode().
* Describe what happens if you override hashCode() but implement public boolean
  equals(OlympicAthlete that) instead of public boolean equals(Object that).
